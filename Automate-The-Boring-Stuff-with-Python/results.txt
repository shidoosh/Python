    <title>Motherfricking Website</title>

        <h1>This is a motherfricking website.</h1>
        <aside>And it's fricking perfect.</aside>
    </header>
        
        <h2>Seriously, what the frick else do you want?</h2>
        
        <p>You probably build websites and think your shiz is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fricking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfricker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your shizty screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your shizty browsers</li>
            <li>The motherfricker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
            <li>Shit's legible and gets your fricking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Well guess what, motherfricker:</h3>
        
        <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shiz. It's a motherfricking website. Why the frick do you need to animate a fricking trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shiz? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fricking site, and some motherfricker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shiz. Not to mention blind people will never see that shiz, but they don't see any of your shizty shiz.</p>
        
        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
        
        <h2>It's fricking lightweight</h2>
        
        <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fricking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fricking background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shizty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of shiz.</p>
        
        <h2>It's responsive</h2>
        
        <p>You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfricking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherfricking Tamagotchi.</p>
        
        <h2>It fricking works</h2>
        
        <p>Look at this shiz. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherfricker. It makes sense. It has motherfricking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the frick's in this fricking site. That's semantics, motherfricker.</p>
        
        <p>It has content on the fricking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
        
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfricker in IE6. I fricking dare you.</p>
        
        <h2>This is a website. Look at it.  You've never seen one before.</h2>
        
        <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fricking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shizty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fricking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fricking beautiful.</p>
        
        <h3>Yes, this is fricking satire, you frick</h3>
        
        <p>I'm not actually saying your shizty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p>

    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
    <p>From the philosophies expressed (poorly) above, <a href="http://txti.es">txti</a> was created. You should try it today to make your own motherfricking websites.</p>
