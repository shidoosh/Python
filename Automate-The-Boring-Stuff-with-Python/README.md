# Automate The Boring Stuff With Python Course
This repo contains all of the exercises as instructed in the Automate the Boring Stuff with Python course. It reviews basic Python, but also introduces very handy tools such as Selenium, pyautogui, webbrowser, and many other 3rd party modules that allow you to interact with and modify data from common sources (the web, pdf/word/excel documents, other Python programs, etc).

It has been especially helpful in optimizing my workflow, such as launching often used programs simultaneously and web browsers windows with frequented pre-populated tabs! A few less clicks go a long way!
