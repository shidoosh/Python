# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Background
This script was inspired by a mini exercise from Automate The Boring Stuff with Python. 
The setup was shown in the course as an example for dictionaries and their helpful use cases. 
It assigned the keys in the dictionary to the corresponding the position on the tic-tac-toe board:  
* top-L, top-M, top-R: top row right column, top row middle column, top row left column
* mid-L, mid-M, mid-R: mid row right column, mid row middle column, mid row left column
* low-L, low-M, low-R: low row right column, low row middle column, low row left column

And the values in the dictionary would represent what character occupied that space: X, O, or empty 

Our dictionary structure represented the following board: 

 top-L | top-M | top-R 
       |       |
\-----------------------
 
 mid-L | mid-M | mid-R 
 
\-----------------------
 
 low-L | low-M | low-R
